Requires SFML-2.4.2

Run the server first and when it loads run two copies of the client.
Press space on both clients and then the game will start.
Use arrow keys to control either client and collect dots.
When one client has ten dots the game will end.
Close the application.

There have been some improvements since my self evaluation during 
the presentation.
I have left a comment at the bottom of the Server's main.cpp file 
explaining what was wrong and how i improved it
