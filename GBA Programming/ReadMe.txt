Upon starting the program you will be able to select the level you wish to play.
Use the up and down keys to cycle through the options and use the A button (Z key) to select the highlighted option.

In the level you will be able to cycle throught the words on screen and select them using the same buttons as before.
When you select a word you will be told the word's likeness to the password, 
which tells you how many letters are the same and in the same position as the letters of the password.
You will also lose an attempt if the word is not the password.
Using this information you are to try and figure out the password and select it using three attempts.

When the password is selected, you will win the game and if you use all three attempts without selecting the password, you lose.
